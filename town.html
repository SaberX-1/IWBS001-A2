                    I was born in Santa Ana, which is the second largest city in El Salvador.<br>
                    El Salvador is a country in Central America, It is bordered on the northeast by Honduras, 
                    on the northwest by Guatemala, and on the south by the Pasific Ocean.

                        Hi, it's a pleasure that you are viewing my website.<br> Please call me Leo. <br>
                        As previusly mentioned, I am currently studying IT. This website is part of my Web system assignment.
                        <br><br> A little info about me.<br><br>
                        I am currently 19 years old, and have a passion for learning and developing new skills. Hence I enjoy building things which live on the internet.
                        My interest to dive into the world of IT began in 2021 where I was studying SDD (Software Design and Development) as my HSC elective.
                        Within the course we learnt python, where I grew interest in the possibilities programming provides.
                        <br>
                        Fast forward to today, I have developed new skills and learnt new languages. <br>
